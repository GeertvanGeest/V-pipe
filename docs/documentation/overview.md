# Overview

V-pipe is a workflow designed for the analysis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data from viral pathogens. It produces a number of results in a curated format (e.g., consensus sequences, SNV calls, local/global haplotypes). V-pipe is written using the Snakemake workflow management system.
